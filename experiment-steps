RELATIVE VS ABSOLUTE DEPTH COMPARISON EXPERIMENTS
Depths to test: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6

relative depth control:
1. Place needle on ilm
2. Start video recording of b-scans
3. Start relative depth control process with test depth
4. Stop video
5. Take C-scan
6. start video recording of b-scans 
7. Validate with bleb
8. Stop video 

Absolute depth contorl
1. Place needle on ilm
2. Take C-scan and calculate target position
3. start recording video
4. Move robot to target position
5. stop video
6. take C-scan
7. start taking video
8. validate with bleb
9. stop video

Post processing
On C-scans calculate error between target and real depth
Make table comparing for each depth the error of depth and bleb accuracy
